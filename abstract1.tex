\chapter*{\Huge\textbf{ABSTRACT}}

\hspace*{5em}Data is an important asset for any individual or organization and must be protected from intruders or hackers. The need to hide data from hackers has existed since ancient times, and nowadays, there are developments in digital media, such as audio, video, images, and so on. To secure secret information, different media methods are used and steganography is one.This project presents video steganography with digital watermarking algorithms as an efficient and robust way for protection. This paper is a combination of Cryptography,Steganography and watermarking algorithms which provides a strong backbone for its security and hiding data in different multimedia files.This proposed system not only hides data but also limits the perceivable distortion that might occur while processing it.\par
Database security is provided by using image CAPTCHA created using Visual Cryptography algorithm. The data is store in database using steganography and watermarking algorithms behind the multimedia files.

The proposed System provides the Confidential Login to user using Visual Cryptography and upload encrypted data Data System using base Steganography.It has the objective to hide data in video and provide security to the same.Our methodology  is  based on Image CAPTCHA validation scheme using visual cryptography.Visual Cryptography is use to preserve the privacy of image CAPTCHA.

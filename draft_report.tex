\section{BACKGROUND}
\hspace*{5em}Steganographic techniques have been used for ages and they date back to ancient Greece. The aim of steganographic communication back then and now, in modern applications, is the same: to hide secret data (a steganogram) in an innocently looking cover and send it to the proper recipient who is aware of the information hiding procedure. In an ideal situation the existence of hidden communication cannot be detected by third parties.

What distinguishes historical steganographic methods from the modern ones is, in fact, only the form of the cover (carrier) for secret data. Historical methods relied on physical Steganography – the employed media were: human skin, game, etc.. Further advances in hiding communication based on the use of more complex covers, e.g. with the aid of ordinary objects, whose orientation was assigned meaning. This is how semagrams were introduced. The popularisation of the written word and the increasing literacy among people had brought about methods which utilised text as carrier. The World Wars had accelerated the development of Steganography by introducing a new carrier – the electromagnetic waves. Presently, the most popular carriers include digital images, audio and video files and communication protocols. The latter may apply to network protocols as well as any other communication protocol (e.g. cryptographic).

The way that people communicate evolved over ages and so did steganographic methods. At the same time, the general principles remained unchanged. 

\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}
\hspace*{5em}In this study we will try to provide "Confidential log in to real user using Visual Cryptography and upload encrypted data on Database System using Steganography".


\section{PURPOSE}
\hspace*{5em}The aim of the project is to build more secure system than previous classical security system.



\section{SCOPE}
\hspace*{5em}The main objective of this project is to hide data  in video and provide security i.e to secure Login to the database. Our methodology is based on Image CAPTCHA validation scheme using visual cryptography for providing Secure Login and the data to be stored in the database is stored in multimedia format using Steganography.

\textbf{1.CAPTCHA as Graphical Passwords—A New Security
Primitive Based on Hard AI Problems
Bin B. Zhu, Jeff Yan, Guanbo Bao, Maowei Yang, and Ning Xu}\\\\
In this paper they have proposed CaRP, a new security primitive relying on unsolved hard AI problems. CaRP is both a CAPTCHA and a graphical password scheme. The notion of CaRP introduces
a new family of graphical passwords, which adopts a new approach to counter online guessing attacks: a new CaRP image, which is also a CAPTCHA challenge, is used for every Login attempt.
CaRP also offers protection against relay attacks, an increasing threat to bypass CAPTCHAs protection, wherein CAPTCHA challenges are relayed to humans to solve. They expect CaRP to inspire new inventions of such AI based security primitives.\\\\

The image hiding method in this paper combine the cryptography and information hiding. On the one hand, by using information hiding does not change the visual characteristic of cover image, On the other hand, by using digital signature and encryption technology of cryptography , we can make the unauthorized users can not
know the location of the embedded secret information, so that the secret information can not be extracted.\\\\

Biometric signals enter more and more into our everyday lives, since governments, as well as other organizations,resort to their use in accomplishing crucial procedures(e.g. citizen authentication). Thus there is an urgent need to further develop and integrate biometric authentication techniques into practical applications.Towards this direction in this paper the domain of biometrics authentication over error-prone networks has been examined. Since Steganography by itself does not ensure
secrecy, it was combined with a chaotic encryption system.The proposed procedure, except of providing results that are imperceptible to the human visual system, it also outputs a stego-object that can resist different signal distortions, and
steganalytic attacks.\\\\

In this paper we implement a new anti-phishing methodology proposed in [1]. It is nothing but visual cryptography in which image CAPTCHA is used to prevent identity theft. When a new user is
registered a CAPTCHA is associated with the user profile. The CAPTCHA image is converted into two shares which are to be kept secret. Only the original user can provide the shares.When both the shares are provided by the user, then only the authentication process gets completed. Thus the proposed system provides complete security to the web site from
phishing attacks.\\\\

There are several mining algorithms of association rules. One of the most popular algorithms is Apriori that is used to extract frequent itemsets from large database and getting the association rule for discovering the knowledge. Based on this algorithm, this paper indicates the limitation of the original Apriori algorithm of wasting time for scanning the whole database searching on the frequent itemsets, and presents an improvement on Apriori by reducing that wasted time depending on scanning only some transactions. The paper shows by experimental results with several groups of transactions, and with several values of minimum support that applied on the original Apriori and our implemented improved Apriori that our improved Apriori reduces the time consumed by 67.38 percent in comparison with the original Apriori, and makes the Apriori algorithm more efficient and less time consuming.\\\\

\chapter{SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION}

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\hspace*{5em}Globalization has led to the rapid growth of the Internet through which consumers can send and receive large amounts of data (e.g., text, audio, video, and images). In modern communication systems, securing data is of utmost importance. Yet sending and receiving secret files over the Internet is still insecure, and therefore hiding data in an effective way protects this secret information.
Data is important to any organization. They must be protected from the unauthorized access. Data should only visible to the sender and receiver of transmitted data, and they should be hidden from hackers. Hiding data is nothing more than protecting the data in some medium or encrypting the data. There are many techniques that use the concept of hiding data; cryptography and Steganography are among them. 

The main focus of this project is to develop a Confidential Login by real user using Visual Cryptography and create encrypted data on Database System using Steganography.\\
\noindent
\textbf{Objectives:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To design  a improved Login system using Visual Cryptography to keep data secure.
\item To design  a application  that enable the hiding of valuable data in multimedia file by means of Steganography..
\item To test the the improved Login system and the application used for Steganography. 
\end{enumerate}
     \subsection{PROJECT SCOPE}
\hspace*{5em}The goal is to provide security  to  the application. Our  methodology  is  based  on  Image  CAPTCHA validation scheme using visual cryptography.  Visual Cryptography is use to preserve the privacy of image CAPTCHA.
     \subsection{USER CLASSES AND CHARACTERISTICS}
\hspace*{5em}This project is meant to provide the security for user to prevent to it from intruders and hackers by providing a secure Login system.This project helps the user to hide his/her valuable data into a file that cannot be claimed of having a hidden message.The application built will hide the data in fraction amount of time.Consequently,the user interface will be less complicated.The permission for accessing the application will  require valid user Credentials i.e Username and password.As we are providing additional security they also need to upload the CaGP i.e CAPTCHA as Graphical Password.This will be generated and send to mail when the user will SignUp/Register.
	\par Its important that the application should work properly,give output in time,have high throughput,have high accuracy but most importantly it must be user friendly.So all the complicated work related to encrypting,hiding and all is done at server site.User just need to upload the data to be hide and the file in which it need to be hide.

      \subsection{OPERATING ENVIRONMENT}
\hspace*{5em}The main component of our project is the application that we are designing to ease the process of hiding data in file. It is a desktop based system along with requirement of Internet connection.The application will require to have a decent Internet to receive the key fro user and send the key i.e CaGP generated at the server site .The Application Programming Interface (API) required for this software will  be  built using Java so we require an editor with Java support that is  will be needing Java Development Kit(JDK).Also the algorithms that are going to be implemented in the system.This software application will  be interacting  with user at start to determine which data is to be hidden in which file.The result that is generated will be stored either in the database or given as a output file that is same as the file selected for hiding the valuable data on end user system.Apart form this since the data is stored in SQL.To store it requires SQL Server and SQL Database.It will require a computer having a Internet connection and windows OS.Also with a 2-4GB of RAM and a storage space of 100GB+.
      \subsection{DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS}
\hspace*{5em}The primary design constraint is the Desktop platform.  Since the application is designated for Desktop Systems, effective GUI and well user friendliness will be  the  major  design considerations. Creating a user interface  which is both effective and easily navigable is important. Also as we are utilizing the database for our major steps based on different algorithms so storage space need to be considered for smooth functioning of system. Other constraints such as memory and processing power are also worth considering. The software will give the desired results only if the specified software requirements are satisfied. Application software designed must implement the algorithms effectively and gives the output successfully also the interface of software must be easy and simple to be understood by user.
           \par The system will accept data as input from user and we need active and smooth Internet connectivity for effective sign in and verification of CaGP to process further.The input to the application is the path of the files that are need to be hidden and in which its need to be hide.There is a drop down option from browsing the path.The encrypted file is just a click away.The encrypted file can be stored in database or can be download by the user.
\newpage
\noindent
     \subsection{ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES}
     This project will work on the minimum system specifications as follow:
\begin{itemize}
\item Windows 7 or 8 or any other new versions with JDK support.
\item 100GB storage space as HDD.
\item Minimum 2-4 GB RAM and i3 processor.
\item Internet connection and smooth access to a network of computers of same physical system configuration.
\item Data stored and accessed from SQL.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Time Dependency:}\\

\noindent
Usability improvements and convenience enhancements that may be added after the application has been developed. Thus, the implementation of these features is entirely dependent upon the time spent designing and implementing the core features. The final decision on whether or not to implement these features will be made during the later stages of the design phase.


%\section{SYSTEM FEATURES}
%This section describes the User interfaces, Hardware interfaces, Software interfaces and Communication interfaces relevant to our project's software application.
\section{EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS}

  \subsection{USER INTERFACES}
\hspace*{5em}The user interface includes sign up and a log in window as soon as the application is starts. In sing up phase user need to choose a Username and password.Along  with this user need to enter the email id and a key which is combination of A-Z,a-z,0-9.After successfully entering the required information at server site a random key is being added to the actual key of the user and by means of visual cryptography the CaGP is generated and then mail it to user.
        \par In log in phase user need to enter its credentials and also need to upload the CaGP for the verification.After the successfully log in the actual process of Steganography starts.User just need to give paths of files and in faction amount of time encrypted data or file is displayed.Which user can download and keep it in database.

 \newpage   
      \subsection{HARDWARE INTERFACES}
The system has following hardware requirements or interfaces:
\begin{itemize}

\item Keyboard:To enter credentials while log in  the system to access it.
\item Mouse:To select the source from drop down menu from which we need to collect data to analyse and predict.
\item Storage:The storage space required to store the collected data as well as output after Steganography.
\item Display Screen:To display the output generated from the application software
\end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{SOFTWARE INTERFACES}
\hspace*{5em}The software interfaces will be the application software developed.The developed software contains-
        \par a)Java Development Kit(JDK)
        \par b)SQL Server
        \par c)SQL Database
        \par d)IDE to build the API.
    
    \subsection{COMMUNICATION INTERFACES}
\hspace*{5em}A file in any format which is going to hide is given as input,and another regular Multimedia file is provided in which we are hiding our earlier file. Generated CaGP send via email to the user using Internet connection. 
    

\section{NON FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS}
\hspace*{5em}These requirements don't affect the system features but play an important role in deciding other factors that are important for a software application to be reliable.
     \subsection{PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS}
\hspace*{5em} The application performance is dependent on the processing speed of the system.Which kind of processor and the amount of RAM and storage available.The time depends the time complexity of the algorithms like Scene change detection,Split Algorithm and Least Significant Bit Algorithm..
     \subsection{SAFETY REQUIREMENTS}
\hspace*{5em}The application doesn't affect any other features on  machine and since no hardware other than system is used there are no specific safety requirements for handling system. During data collection and processing we have to just take care that system is capable to scale up the storage space so that data is processed without any loss of data and accurate output is generated.
     \subsection{SECURITY REQUIREMENTS}
\hspace*{5em}The application have wide range of applications so security is a very important part of the application. As it is use to generate a file which contains a valuable data and if such data gets leaked that can cause disaster and is related to the people security. Thus we include a secure log in system which include user credential along with a CaGP which is verified before giving access to the application that contain the valuable data and have a ability to create such files.Because of CaGP the misused and security is maintained and no compromise is done.
     \subsection{SOFTWARE QUALITY ATTRIBUTES}
The application software gives justice to important quality attributes such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Flexibility:}\\ Input related to various domains accepted by the system.
\item \textbf{Reliability:}\\ System generates a file which contain the valuable data that is hidden and normal human eye cannot differentiate
between the normal file and the encrypted one.
\item \textbf{Usability:}\\Provides simple user interface easily accessible by the concerned user.
\item \textbf{Scalability:}\\System can be used to hide various valuable data in a file.the size of the file can be in Kb or in Mb.
\item \textbf{Security:}\\Secure as the system asks for user's credentials along with CaGP to provide access to system.
\item \textbf{Dependability:}\\the working of the application depends on the configuration of the system where we deploy it.
\end{itemize}     
    
\noindent
\section{OTHER REQUIREMENTS}
\hspace*{5em}These are optional requirements which are not of that importance but if included gives an additive advantage to the application software usage.
    \subsection{DATABASE REQUIREMENTS}
\hspace*{5em} Application need a database to store the encrypted files and the user related information. We are using SQL Database to store the information.Database will be required to store the images and also the user details and other details that will be required and used for giving the users a better quality experience. To design the database MySQL will be used. Initially we will create a database for storing the user details. Another database is created to store image CAPTCHA and shares. Third Database to store watermarked video. So the database must be dynamic and scalable to avoid any constrains during the working of application.
    \subsection{INTERNALIZATION REQUIREMENTS}
\hspace*{5em}As the application have a property to hide a valuable data and have a high security its not limited to a particular region or place.It has a wide application in all fields and to meet the internationalization requirements application need to scale up and need to support all the files that can be use to encrypt the data
    \subsection{LEGAL REQUIREMENTS}
\hspace*{5em}The application that we are designing is a application to be used by users,private organizations,government organization,military and many more so we need to make sure that our system doesn't violate any laws regarding security and also it is not accessible to criminals or any other unauthorized person.We need to also take care that the system is well secured, either the application is available to other people.The other aspect of such requirement is that we need to make sure system is not exploited by anybody or in any form discredited as it will be our responsibility.

\chapter{SYSTEM DESIGN}

\section{SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE}
The overall system design consists of following modules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item SignUp phase
\item Login phase
\item Steganography
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Steganography}
	
	\end{figure}


\hspace*{0.01em}
To work with this application first user needs to SignUp.In SignUp user needs to chose the Username and password along with this user need to enter email id and along with that tp generate the CaGP user need to enter a special key which contains the  string made of A-Z,a-z,0-9 combinations.At server side the key is generated by adding a random key which is made from combinations of A-Z,a-z,0-9 and then the key is generated in the form of CAPTCHA by using Visual cryptography.The generated CaGP is then mail to user for further process.Now for Login user need to its credentials along CaGP.
Now the entered CaGP is verified at server site,then user gets access to the application .
now user needs to upload the the data that he wants to hide,along with he needs to upload a file in which he wants to hide the data.
after uploading the data the actual process starts.Firstly the file in which the data is to be hide is broken into frames and a respective color histogram is form for each frame,its done by using SCENE CHANGE DETECTION ALGORITHM.
now the data which need to be hide is broken into the chunk by SPLIT ALGORITHM.After this the process of hiding the data starts with the leas significant bit




\section{UML DIAGRAMS}

\section*{\underline{Definition}}
\hspace*{5em}The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a general purpose,developmental, modelling language in the field of software
engineering, that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system. UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design.


\section*{\underline{Design}}
The Unified Modelling Language (UML) offers a way to visualize a system's architectural blueprints in a diagram  including elements such as:
\begin{itemize}


\item Any activities.
\item Individual components of the system:
And how they can interact with other software components.
\item How the system will run.
\item How entities interact with others (components and interfaces)
\item External user interface
\end{itemize}
\hspace*{5em}Although originally intended solely for object oriented design documentation, the Unified Modelling Language (UML) has been extended to cover a larger set of design documentation.


\section*{\underline{UML System Model}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Static (or structural) view:}\\
Emphasizes the static structure of the system using objects, attributes,
operations and relationships. The structural view includes class diagrams and composite structure
diagrams.
\item \textbf{Dynamic (or behavioural) view:}\\
Emphasizes the dynamic behaviour of the system by showing collaborations among objects and changes to the internal states of objects. This view includes sequence diagrams, activity diagrams and state machine diagrams.
\end{itemize}

\section*{\underline{UML Models}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Use case diagram:}\\
To model a system the most important aspect is to capture the dynamic behaviour.
To clarify a bit in details, dynamic behaviour means the behaviour of the system when it is running /operating.
So only static behaviour is not sufficient to model a system rather dynamic
behaviour is more important than static behaviour.These internal and external agents are known as actors. So use case diagrams are consists of actors, use cases and their relationships. The diagram is used to model the system/subsystem of an application. A single use case diagram captures a particular functionality of a system.
So to model the entire system numbers of use case diagrams are used.
\item \textbf{Deployment Diagram:}\\
Deployment diagrams are used to visualize the topology of the physical
components of a system where the software components are deployed.
So deployment diagrams are used to describe the static deployment view of a system. Deployment diagrams consist of nodes and their relationships.
The name Deployment itself describes the purpose of the diagram. Deployment diagrams are used for describing the hardware components where software components are deployed. Component diagrams and deployment diagrams are closely related.
UML is mainly designed to focus on software artefacts of a system. But these two diagrams are special diagrams used to focus on software components and hardware components.So most of the UML diagrams are used to handle logical components but
deployment diagrams are made to focus on hardware topology of a system.
Deployment diagrams are used by the system engineers.
\item \textbf{Activity Diagram:}\\
Activity diagram is basically a flow chart to represent the flow form one activity toanother activity. The activity can be described as an operation of the system.So the control flow is drawn from one operation to another. This flow can be sequential, branched or concurrent. Activity diagrams deals with all type of flow control by using different elements like fork, join etc.
It captures the dynamic behaviour of the system. Other four diagrams are used to show the message flow from one object to another but activity diagram is used to show message flow from one activity to another.
It does not show any message flow from one activity to another. Activity diagram is some time considered as the flow chart. Although the diagrams looks like a flow chart but it is not. It shows different flow like parallel, branched, concurrent and single.

\noindent
\item \textbf{Sequence Diagram:}\\
A Sequence diagram is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with
one another and in what order. It is a construct of a Message Sequence Chart. A sequence
diagram shows object interactions arranged in time sequence. It depicts the objects
and classes involved in the scenario and the sequence of messages exchanged between
the objects needed to carry out the functionality of the scenario. Sequence diagrams
are typically associated with use case realizations in the
Logical View of the system under development. Sequence diagrams are sometimes called
event diagrams or event scenarios.
A sequence diagram shows, as parallel vertical lines (lifelines), different processes
or objects that live simultaneously, and, as horizontal arrows, the messages exchanged between them, in the order in which they occur. This allows the specification of simple runtime scenarios in a graphical manner.

\item \textbf{State Chart Diagram:}\\
The name of the diagram itself clarifies the purpose of the diagram and other details. It describes different states of a component in a system. The states are specific to a component/object of a system. A State chart diagram describes a state machine. Now to clarify it state machine can be defined as a machine which defines different states of an object and these states are controlled by external or internal events. Activity diagram explained in next chapter, is a special kind of a State chart diagram. As State chart diagram defines states it is used to model lifetime of an object. State chart diagram is one of the five UML diagrams used to model dynamic nature of a system. They define different states of an object during its lifetime. And these states are changed by events. So State chart diagrams are useful to model reactive systems. Reactive systems can be defined as a system that responds to external or internal events. State chart diagram describes the flow of control from one state to another state. States are defined as a condition in which an object exists and it changes when some event is triggered.

\newpage
\item \textbf{Class Diagram:}\\
In software engineering, a class diagram in the Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a type of
static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or
methods), and the relationships among objects.The class diagram is the main building block of object oriented modelling. It is used both for general
conceptual modelling of the systematics of the application, and for detailed modelling translating the models into programming code. Class diagrams can also be used for data modelling.In the diagram, classes are represented with boxes which contain
three parts as follows the top part contains the name of the class, the middle part contains the attributes of the class and the bottom part contains the methods the class can execute.\\

\chapter{RESULTS}
\section{EXPECTED RESULTS}
\hspace*{5em}Application will be able to successfully the encrypt the data into the file with the help of data provided by user.the data generated is not easy to detect normal humans eyes and it provide security from intruders and hackers.Because of the modified Login system, the system will be more secure than previous one and the valuable data of user will not be compromised.

\chapter{CONCLUSION}
\hspace*{5em}\\The application that we have build has a more secure Login system and data is protected from intruders and hackers.The data that user want to keep safe,secure and preserve is done by hiding it in in another file without destroying the file used to hide.The safety measures ,legals are all maintain without exploiting the rules.

Thus, on the basis of literature survey and by analysing the existing system, we have came to a conclusion that the proposed system will not only provide the secured Login to system but also it will help to keeps its data safe.
